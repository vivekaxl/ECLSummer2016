NAME NewComposition;
LABEL "New Composition";
AUTHOR "riskid";
VERSION "1.0.0";
DESCRIPTION "Sample Template for a new composition.
This composition includes two plugins, UseDataset (which reads data in from a thor file)
hooked up to OutDataset (which writes data out to a thor file). Both are located in your 
HPCCSystems/(version)/HIPIE_Plugins folder. This folder is retrieved via git from 
http://gitlab.ins.risk.regn.net/HIPIE/HIPIE_Plugins.
Plugin Developers may replace this with their own plugin repo by editing the repositories.cfg
file in the HPCCSystems/(version) directory.
The AUTHOR should be your risk ID, just the name without @risk at the end or RISK/ at the beginning.
Saving this composition inside ECL IDE will generate a new module named HIPIE_(composition name) that contains
the ecl generated by HIPIE for this composition. You may need to refresh the repository window 
for the new module to appear.
Sometimes ECL IDE does not accurately report all errors encountered when validating a composition.
the errors can also be found at c:\users\userid\AppData\Local\Temp\err.log";
